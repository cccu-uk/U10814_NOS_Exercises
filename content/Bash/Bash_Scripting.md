# Bash Scripting

---

## JupyterHub

1. Navigate to [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.uk/) 
   - an online environment where you can code and explore the Shell.
2. Login to [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.canterbury.ac.uk/) using your CCCU user account credentials.

3. Start your server... 
   ![](../Exploring_Directories/fig/jh-server.png)

1. Open shell environment and `cd` to `NOS`, `$ cd ~/NOS`
![](../Exploring_Directories//fig/jh-terminal-launch.png)
1. Make new directory, `$ mkdir scripting`

## Task 1. `#!` Shebang/hashbang

1. Create a new file called `script.sh`
   - `$ touch script.sh`
2. Then edit the file
   - `$ nano script.sh`
3. Reproduce the following...
   ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/env cat
    VAR1=Hello
    VAR2=World!
    VAR3=Goodbye

    echo ${VAR1} ${VAR2}
    echo ${VAR3} ${VAR2}
   ```
4. Write out `ctrl+x` 
5. Modify the file's mode bits so that it becomes an executable 
   ```sh
   $ ls -l
   $ chmod +x script.sh
   $ ls -l
   ```
   - performing `ls -l` either side of the `chmod` command shows the information about the file such as its mode bits.
  
     - **Before:**
       ```sh
       -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan users  107 Feb 22 12:35 script.sh
       ```
     - **After:**
       ```sh
       -rwxr-xr-x 1 jovyan users    107 Feb 22 12:35 script.sh
       ```
6. Now you are going to run the script two ways. 
   - first way is to call the script via bash directly:
     ```sh
     $ bash script.sh
     ```
     - **Ouput:**
       ```sh
       Hello World!
       Goodbye World!
       ```
    - Second way is to run the script as an executable 
     ```sh
     ./script.sh
     ```
     - **Ouput:**
       ```sh
       #! /usr/bin/env cat
        VAR1=Hello
        VAR2=World!
        VAR3=Goodbye
        echo ${VAR1} ${VAR2}
        echo ${VAR3} ${VAR2}
       ```
7. Lets modifiy the script so that the `#! /usr/bin/env wc`
   - write out `ctrl+x`
   - What will running the script do?
   - Run it and find out.
        <details>
        <summary>Answer</summary>

        ```sh
        $ ./script.sh
            12 97 ./script.sh
        ```
        </details>

So you can see that the `#!` is only operated on when the script is run as an executable, where as using `bash` command we are calling the interpreter directly and it ignores the `#!`.

## Task 2. Variables

1. create a new file and call it `int-or-string.sh`
2. Reproduce the following:
   ```sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
   A=2334                   # Integer... though still a string
   echo "A = ${A} "           # a = 2335
   A=$(( ${A} + 1 )) # increment A by 1.
   echo "A = ${A} "           # a = 2335
   echo                     # Integer, still.
   ```
3. You can change the mode bits again if you like or run with just `bash`.
   - `bash int-or-string.sh`
   - or `chmod +x int-or-string.sh`, `./int-or-string.sh`
   - **Output:**
     ```sh
     A = 2334
     A = 2335 
     ```
  - This behaved as expected, using arthemtric expansion `$((...))` to increment variable `A` by 1.
4. Modify the script to include, pay attention to the comments.
   ```sh
   B=${A/23/BB}             # Substitute "BB" for "23".
                            # This transforms $b into a string.
   echo "B = ${B}"          # B = BB35
   declare -i B             # Declaring it an integer doesn't help.
   echo "B = ${B}"          # B = BB35

   B=$(( ${B} + 1 ))        # BB35 + 1
   echo "B = $B"            # B = 1
   echo                     # Bash sets the "integer value" of a string to 0.

   C=BB34
   echo "C = $C"            # C = BB34
   D=${C/BB/23}             # Substitute "23" for "BB".
                            # This makes $D an integer.
   echo "D = ${D}"          # D = 2334
   D=$(( ${D} + 1 ))        # 2334 + 1
   echo "D = ${D}"          # D = 2335
   echo
   ```
   - **Output:**
   ```sh
   A = 2334
   A = 2335 

   B = BB35
   B = BB35
   B = 1

   C = BB34
   D = 2334
   D = 2335
   ```
5. Still on Variables... create a new script called `my-name-is.sh`
   - reproduce the following code, like from the lecture slide.
     ```sh
     #! /usr/bin/env bash
     GREETING=Hi
     STATEMENT="my name is,"
     INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN1=what?
     INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN2=who?
     NAME=${1:-"Slim Shady"}
     ALLITERATION=chka-chka

     echo ${STATEMENT} ${INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN1}
     echo ${STATEMENT} ${INTERROGATIVEPRONOUN2}
     echo ${STATEMENT} ${ALLITERATION} ${NAME}
     ```
   - again note the Uppercase standard for nameing convention here. 
   - Notice how not all variables values are explicitly declared as string `""`. You only need to do this if there are spaces between letters/words.
   - run the command.
     ```sh
      $ bash my-name-is.sh
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```sh
     my name is, what?
     my name is, who?
     my name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
     ``` 
   - But hold on... what about `NAME=${1:-"Slim Shady"}`
     - Well this special operation allows default values to be assigned to the variable if something is `null` such as `1` is the positional number for a parameter coming into the script when it is called from the CLIm if this is `null` then set `NAME=Slim Shady`. 
   - Try calling the script but this time provide your first name, or mulitple names encapsulated with `"name name name"`
        ```sh
        $ bash my-name-is.sh Seb
        ```  
    - **Output:**
        ```sh
        my name is, what?
        my name is, who?
        my name is, chka-chka Seb
        ```

## Task 3.  Special parameters and conditions

So now you are going to understand in more detail how parameters work.

1. Create a new script called `parameters.sh`
2. edit the script to look like this:
    ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/env bash
    while getopts u:a:f: flag
    do
    case "${flag}" in
        u) username=${OPTARG};;
        a) age=${OPTARG};;
        f) fullname=${OPTARG};;
    esac
    done
    echo "Username: $username" echo "Age: $age" echo "Full Name: $fullname"
    ```
    - Run the script by only supplying your username, age and full name.
    - What happened?
      <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>

      ```sh
      bash parameters.sh sb1501 nonyabusiness "Seb Blair"
      Username:  echo Age:  echo Full Name: 
      ```
      
      </details>
    - Try again this time provide your a `-u` then the username.
      <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>

      ```sh
      bash parameters.sh -u sb1501 nonyabusiness "Seb Blair"
      Username: sb1501 echo Age:  echo Full Name: 
      ```
      
      </details>
    - Repeat but provide all options `-u`, `-a`, and `-f`
      <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>

      ```sh
      bash parameters.sh -u sb1501 -a nonyabusiness -f "Seb Blair"
      Username: sb1501 echo Age: nonyabusiness echo Full Name: Seb Blair
      ```
      
      </details>
3. Modify the code again, so that parameters can be precheck before coming to `getopts`
   ```sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
   if [[ $# -gt 6 ]];then
      echo -e "Too many arguments supplied:\n$#"
      exit 1
   elif [[ $# == 0 ]]; then
      echo -e "Not enough arguments supplied:\n$#"
      exit 1
   fi

   while getopts u:a:f: flag
   do
   case "${flag}" in
      u) username=${OPTARG};;
      a) age=${OPTARG};;
      f) fullname=${OPTARG};;
   esac
   done
   echo "Username: $username"  "Age: $age"  "Full Name: $fullname"
   ```
  - Try to run the script with no parameters, what happens?
  - Try to run the script with more than 6 parameters, what happens?
  - What about providing a flag that is not accounted for?
    ```sh
    bash parameters.sh -U sb1501 -a nonyabusiness -f "Seb Blair"
    ``` 
    <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    
-    ```sh
    $ bash parameters.sh -U sb1501 -a nonyabusiness -f "Seb Blair"
      parameters.sh: illegal option -- U
      Username:  Age:  Full Name: 
    ```
    So you see that the `getopts` deals with illegal options.

    Out of curosity, what happens if you change your parameters orders..?

## Task 4. Reading from stdin

Here you are replicating what was in the lecture using the `read` command to caputer user input.

1. create a new script called `userinput.sh`
2. reproduce the following code, pay attention to the comments:
```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash
echo -n "Enter your name:"
read NAME # stores user's input 
echo "Your name is:" ${NAME} # prints user's input

# prompt with and stores user's input 
read -p "Enter your name: " NAME 
echo Your name is ${NAME}.

# prompt with suppressed feature enable so user input is hidden
read  -t  5 -p "Enter your password: "$'\n' -s PASSWORD 
echo ${PASSWORD} # though it is stored as plain text here... 

read -a WORDS <<< "Hello world!" # stores an array '-a` 
echo ${WORDS[0]} # accessing the arrays indicies
echo ${WORDS[1]} 
echo ${WORDS[@]} # access the entire array
echo ${#WORDS[1]}  # get length of the index
echo ${#WORDS[@]} # get lenght of array
```

----

## Task 5. Loops

1. Create a new script called `forloops.sh`
2. Reproduce the following code, pay attention to the comments.
   ```sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
   DIR="task5"

   # if directory (-d) does not exist (!), then create it
   if [[ ! -d ${DIR} ]]; then 
     mkdir ${DIR} && echo "${DIR} created" # if successful printout created
   fi
   # a becomes 1 then 2, and 3 and this is appended to the word foo_ to 
   # create files in the directory that was created.
   for a in 1 2 3 ; do
      touch ${DIR}/foo_$a
   done
   ```
3. Run this command, and see if you get a new directory filled with files.

4. You can check by running the ls  & wc -l command in terminal:
   
   ```sh
   $ ls task5/ | wc -l
   ```

5. Lets modify the script again
   
   ```sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
   DIR="task5"
   
   # if directory (-d) does not exist (!), then create it
   if [[ ! -d ${DIR} ]]; then
       mkdir ${DIR} && echo "${DIR} created" # if successful printout created
   fi
   # counts the number of files in the directory 
   # you can run commands and save the outputs to variables using $(...)
   COUNT=$( ls ${DIR} | wc -l )
   # arthimetic operations can be formed using $((...))
   BOUND=$(( ${COUNT}+5 )) 
 
   #  using the seq command you can create sequence from one number to 
   # another... seq a b, 1 to 10 for example.
   # this way we can create a new file proceeding the last file in the dir
   for a in $( seq ${COUNT} ${BOUND} ) ; do
      touch ${DIR}/foo_$a
   done
   ```

6. Run the command and perform the command `ls task5/ | wc -l` to see if the files have been created. Rinse and repeat a few times to see if it works.

7. Now create a `whileloop.sh` file
   ```sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash
    COUNTER=1

    while [ ${COUNTER} -lt 10 ]
    do
    echo ${COUNTER}
    COUNTER=$(( ${COUNTER}+1 ))
    done
    echo All done

    until [ ${COUNTER} -eq 0 ]
    do
    echo ${COUNTER}
    COUNTER=$((${COUNTER}-1))
    done
    echo All done
   ```   
 - Run this and see the output in the terminal,
   - experiment with:
     -  `-lt` less than
     -  `-le` less than equal to
     -  `-eq` equal to
     -  `-ge` greater than equal to
     -  `-gt` greater than
